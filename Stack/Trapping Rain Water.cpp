Platform :- Geeksforgeeks
Approach :- We can trap water in non-decresasing subsequence from (0th index to 'last_max_elemet') and non_increasing sequence from (n-1 to max_element)we also maintain
           vis array to store the index which are already being used.
           We will use stack to find non- increasing and non_decreasing subsequence.
Time Complexity :- O(N)
