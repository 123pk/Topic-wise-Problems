Platform :- Coding Competition with google
Contest :- Google Kickstart Round D 2022
Approach :- We can have 'k' moves so we will try to divide the moves optimally such that we get maximum sum , for each 'i' from 0 to 'k' we will do (i) operations from first
            array and min(m,k-i) operations from array 2 , in those moves we will find the max value we can acheive and max of sum of all those value pair is our solution.
