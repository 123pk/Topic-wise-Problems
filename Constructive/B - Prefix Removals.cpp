Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 778(Div 1 + Div 2)
Approach :- We will traverse through the array and it is optimal to choose a prefix of size '1' and remove it , so we will look for the first character where our frequency
            of that character is '1' , all the characters from that character to the end cannot be removed and are left.
