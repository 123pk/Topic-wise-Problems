/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- We will use queue data structure to implement the desired iterator
            --> Queue front() to peek
            --> for returning next value we will first get the element and earase it from queue and return the delted element
            --> if queue is not empty we will return true else false in ( is Next())
