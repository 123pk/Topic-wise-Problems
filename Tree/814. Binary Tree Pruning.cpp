/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Apporach :- We will do dfs and will take care from where we get the '1' ( in left subtree or right) ,  we remove the edge which doesnot give us '1' or which does not
            contain '1' (left child or right child edge).
            
Time Complexity :- O(n) --> n = number of edges
