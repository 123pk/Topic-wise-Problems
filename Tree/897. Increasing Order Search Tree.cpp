/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- We will first get all the values of tree and sort them in increasing order , second option is to traverse in "inorder" and get the values they will already be
            in sorted order, now we create a new tree with all the reuqirements , basically we make all the right child to null and attach with left child only.
