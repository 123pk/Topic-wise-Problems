/*
Platform :- CSES Problem set 
Approach :- This is also based on diameter of tree problem , the max distance of any node is the maximum of value of distances from end points of diameter .
           So first we will find end points of diameter and then we will find the distance of each noode from those points ,the max value out of two is the required value
           for each node .
Time Complexity :- O(n) -- time for dfs call 
Space Complexity :- O(n) where n is no of nodes
