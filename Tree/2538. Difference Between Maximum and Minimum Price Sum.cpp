Platform :- Leetcode
Contest :- Leetcode Weekly contest 328
Approach :- We want two things from each child for each node , the ( not_removed_sum , removed_sum)
            not_removed_sum - max sum of path of nodes ( we have not removed leaf_value)
            removed_sum - max sum of path of nodes ( we have already removed leaf value )
            
            -- we want to find the max sum in both cases.
