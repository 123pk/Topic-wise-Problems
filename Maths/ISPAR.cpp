Approach :- if k == 1, then we will always get the current parity of 'n'
            else for k = 2, we will always get 'ODD' parity
            else for all other values we will get even parity.
            
            Why , because we will always be left with 2 to k-1, values and on each move we will get rid of odd elements except of the case when k = 2
