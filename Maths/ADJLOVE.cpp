Approach :- if we have odd no of consecutive odd numbers then the sum of product is even , so we want to have even odd no cosecutively , if we have only one odd no then 
            it is not possible , or if we have '0' odd number or all odd number then also we have no possible permutation.
            else we take all the even values in beginning and odd at the end , if we have odd no of odd numbers then we add one odd number to beginning ,before even numbers
