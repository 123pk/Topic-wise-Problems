Contest :- Codeforces Round 834
Approach:- We don't have any solution when max distance of a and b from fathest end is <= x
           1. if a and b are same then there is no need of any operatino 
           2. if abs(a-b)>=x then 1 operation is rquired
           3. Get to one of the end end try to get to b if it is possible then 2 operation
           4. else 3 opearation
