Platform :- Coding Competition with google
Contest :- Google Kickstart Round C
Approach :- So for test case one , we will try out all the possible options we have and look for palindromic substring after each operation .
            Let 'd' be count of points we have and 'x' be total substrings then we will need to find (d/x)%mod .
            --> You need to know modular arithmetic for this 
                 (a/b) % mod = a* ( b^(mod-2)) % mod)  , where mod is prime

Time Complexity :- O(n!)
