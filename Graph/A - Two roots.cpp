Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 333 Div 1 
Approach :- IF you will analyse you will find that shortest path of one of medium (railways , road) is 1 as if there is no track from (1-->n) then there will surely be one
            road from (1-->n) and vice versa . 
            Now problem comes donw to finding the smallest path from 1 to n in other medium , if we cannot reach to n then it is '-1' else it is that path len our solution
Time complexity :- O(V+E)
