Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 565 Div 3
Approach :- We choose any node and find one end of diameter ( farthest node from this choosen node is one end of diameter) . Now we make that node as root and do bfs
            from this and we find no of nodes in (odd level) and in (even level) . So the min of no of (odd level nodes and even level nodes) is choosen and marked
