/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Approach :- Since we need to partition our array into equal sum them the total_sum of array need to be even else we can't partition them into two ,
            now the problem is reduced to checking if there is subset of sum  = (total_sum/2), we will use knapsack dp to find this .
