/*
Platform :- CSES
Approach :- We will use 'dp[n][100001]' , so we have 'n' values and we can use them one in any subset , so what we willd o is we will run a loop from 0 to n
            then inside the loop we will run from '0' to max_sum possible and will check if (j-A[i]) is already reached then we can reach [i][j] .
