/*
Platform :- Leetcode
Qualtiy :- Very Good
Approach :- We first sort the dimennsions of array in increasing order as we can rotate in any direction and can make any type of box,
            now we sort the values off finaly array in increasing order .
            If you can broadly see then this problem is now reduced down to finding the LIS of the 2-D array .
            So we use Dp to find LIS in O(n^2)
Time Complexity :- O(n^2)
