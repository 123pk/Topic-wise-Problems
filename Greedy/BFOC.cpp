Platform :- Codchef
Contest :- Codechef Lunctime April 2022
Approach :- We will start distributing candies from the last frined (nth one) , if for ith friend the no of buckets is > candies available then we will ignore all the
            friends from (i) to (candies+i) ans they will not be able to get even 1 candi, so we will perform the same operation till the time no of candies are >=(k)
            and we have not reached the starting child.
