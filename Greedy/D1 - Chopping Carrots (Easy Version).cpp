Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 809 Div 2
Approach :- Since the constraints are small , we will try to covert each value in array to nearest possible value of 'i' for all 'i' from '1' to 3000 , solution is 
            the min difference between the max and min value near to 'i'
