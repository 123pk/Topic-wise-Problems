/*
Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 794 Div 2
Approach :- First we will sort our first array and after that we will check if our second array is sorted or not , if it is not sorted and the elements which we need to
            swap are distinct in array 1 we cannot sort it as if we will try to swap them then it will make array 1 unsorted .
            else we print the indexes we need to swap .
Runtime :- O(n log n) --> due to sorting
