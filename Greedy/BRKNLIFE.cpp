Approach :- If 'A' is subsequenece of 'S' then there is no way we can get 'S1' in this case we print -1
            else we find the missing character starting from left to right while checking for subsequence , and similarly form right to left 
            we ignore these two characters and choose any characters different from this and fill them in '?'
