Contest :- Codeforces Starters 26 
Approach :- First sort the characters of both the Alice and Bob string and now greedily choose on their turn and add desired character to the solution at desired position
          * Alice want the resultant string to be Lexiographically smaller so he will choose the smallest characters to be positoned in the smallest index possible
          * Bob want the resultant string to  be Lexiographically larger so he will choose the bigger character to be positioned in the largest index possible
