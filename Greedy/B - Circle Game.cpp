Platform :- Codeforces 
Contest :- Codeforces Round 801 Div 2
Approach :- If n is odd then , Mike will always win .
            If n is even, then there are two cases when the smallest value that one can get in their turn is equal , then the first player to reach to smallest value
            is looser , if the smallest values are different then the one with smaller min value looses.
