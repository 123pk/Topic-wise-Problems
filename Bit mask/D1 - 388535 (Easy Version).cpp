Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 779 Div 2
Approach :- We will maintian one frequency array and will store the frequency of each bit in array for values from (0 to r) , now we create another frequecy array
            where we store the frequency of bit of array given , now we compare the bits of both arrays and if they are not equal we will add 2^i value where 'i' is ith bit
            as that bit is altered.
