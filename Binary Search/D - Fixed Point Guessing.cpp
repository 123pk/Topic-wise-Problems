Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Round 803 Div 2
Approach :- We will definitely use binary search as ( n < 10000) and no of queries is atmax (15) , now we want to know how to check if an range [l,r] contain 
            the fixed point or not , so the range will contain fixed point if count = number of values in range are (l<=x <=r) if this count is odd.
