Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Educational Round 131
Approach :- We will do binary search on it , since max no of days can be 2*m , so for 'i' no of days we can find total no of tasks that can be completed by labours 
            if tot_task_completed >= m , then we can do all the task in 'i' days , so using binary search we can do find the value.
