Platform :- Codeforces
Contest :- Codeforces Global Round 24
Approach :- So it is of no use if we use a distinct value in our subarray as it will not effect our answer, so we can add any number of distinct values 
             so [1,n] is one of the subarrays which give us the max score.
Time Complexity :-O(n) -- reading input
